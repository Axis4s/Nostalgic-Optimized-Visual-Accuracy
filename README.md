# Nostalgic Optimized Visual Accuracy (N.O.V.A)
Shaders/Scripts loosely emulating Nintendo 64's fifth-generation graphics for Godot

This project is mostly made with Godot 4's Compatibility Renderer in mind but shaders should still work
as expected in Forward+ / Mobile renderers.

Some Elements in this project aren't accurate at all compared to the real N64 hardware but the acronym "Nostalgic Optimized Visual Accuracy" (N.O.V.A) was too nice to let go lol.
